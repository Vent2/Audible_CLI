# AudibleCli

For all the Sci-Fi lovers out there I created a gem that scrapes the website for Audible. It will them return you a list of the top Sci-Fi series and then if any of those peak your interest you can find a summary on it.Also the price and url of the first book if you want to give it a try.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'audible_cli'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install audible_cli

## Usage

To start the app while you're in the Audible_Cli type into the terminal ./bin/audible and that should run the app.
After a menu prompt will apear giving you some options og series you can check out. After finding what series you would like to check out put the corresponding number input to find out more.You can also type list into the terminal if you have forgotten the name of a series. Lastly you can type exit to end the app.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
